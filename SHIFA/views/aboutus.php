        </p>
        <p>
            At SHIFA, we go a step further by not only listing pharmacies but also showing them from the nearest to
            the furthest location to streamline your search.<br>
            If a pharmacy is farther away, we make it easy for you to reserve the medication online, holding it for a
            specified period so you can pick it up at your convenience.<br>
            Our aim is to provide peace of mind, ensuring your medication is ready when you need it.
        </p>
